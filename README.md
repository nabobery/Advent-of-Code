Welcome to my repository containing solutions to the Advent of Code challenges.

## About Advent of Code

Advent of Code is an annual event created by [Eric Wastl](https://adventofcode.com/about) where participants solve daily programming puzzles throughout the month of December. Each day, a new set of two puzzles is released, covering a variety of topics such as algorithms, data structures, and mathematical concepts. It is a great way to improve problem-solving skills, discover new features of programming languages, and engage with a community of developers

## Puzzle Solutions

In this repository, you'll find my solutions to the Advent of Code challenges. I've used multiple programming languages such as C++, Python,  and Go to solve these puzzles, showcasing versatility and flexibility in my approach. 

## Directory Structure

The repository is organized by years, and within each year, there are directories for each day's challenges. The directory structure looks like this:

```plaintext
.
└── Year
    ├── Day1
    │   ├── input.txt
    │   ├── solution.py
    │   └── solution.cpp
    ├── Day2
    │   ├── input.txt
    │   ├── solution.cpp
    │   └── solution.go
    └── ...
```

- **Year:** Corresponds to the Advent of Code year (e.g., 2023).
- **DayX:** Represents the challenges for each day.
  - **input.txt:** Input data provided for the challenge.
  - **solution1/2.ext:** Solution for Part 1/2 of the challenge.
  - **solution.ext:** Solution for both Part 1 and Part 2 of the challenge.

## Languages Used

- **Advent of Code 2023:** C++, Go
- **Advent of Code 2022:** Python, C++
- **Advent of Code 2021:** C++

## Happy coding and enjoy the Advent of Code journey!

**Note:**
- The solutions are crafted to be readable emphasizing good coding practices but are not necessarily optimized for speed or efficiency.
- The solutions are not the only way to solve the challenges. There are many other ways to solve the challenges, and I encourage you to explore them.
- The solutions are not intended to be copied and submitted as your own. Please use them as a reference to help you solve the challenges.
